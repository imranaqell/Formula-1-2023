Key Points from the Main Race:

1. Max Verstappen won the Qatar Grand Prix with a dominant performance. He led every lap and got the fastest lap, which awarded him another Grand Slam.

2. Mercedes drivers Lewis Hamilton and George Russell collided on the first lap, leading to Hamilton's immediate retirement from the race. However, George Russell made a remarkable recovery drive to finish fourth after being last following the incident.

3. Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris, both McLaren drivers, finished second and third, respectively. It was a great comeback, as they were awarded a grid drop following a track limit violation during qualifying.

4. Alfa Romeo secured their first double-point finish of the season, with Valtteri Bottas and Zhou Guanyu in eighth and ninth.

5. The format in which FIA limits tyre usage to 18 laps made the race tedious, as the Formula 1 race is a technological race in which the teams compete to create a car with minimal tyre usage.
