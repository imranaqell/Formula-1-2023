1. Max Verstappen pulls the perfect lap when it matters the most, scoring pole position with a comfortable 0.3s gap to Charles Leclerc in second.

2. In sector 2, Max seems to carry more speed in each and every corner compared to Charles Leclerc, which rewards him handsomely.

3. Sergio Perez was on a decent lap until Oscar Piastri spun, which caused yellow flags, which troubled him in finishing his lap as he had to slow down.

4. In Q3, everyone’s lap was far from optimal as unpredictable wind direction was happening, causing everyone to miss apexes and lose lots of time.

5. Lance Stroll out qualifies his teammate, Fernando Alonso, on merit. He was showing some decent performance in his unpredictable car due to recent upgrades and updates.

1. Lando Norris scored a sprint pole; it proves that Mclaren was capable of scoring a pole on Friday, but the team pulled a blunder by letting him out of the pits at the very last minute.

2. Max Verstappen lost pole by less than 0.1s, this is due to the fact that Lando Norris had a major straight-line speed advantage.

3. Sergio Perez seems to be strong again; he was able to qualify less than a tenth of a second of his dominant teammate, Max Verstappen.

4. George Russell seems to regain his confidence; he out qualifies his teammate, Lewis Hamilton by less than 0.1s. He was strong in the middle sector.

5. Mercedes seems to fully focus on the race, their main weakness is the long straight before Turn 1, where their straight line speed wasn’t spectacular.

**Sprint Race**

1. Max Verstappen and Lando Norris are out of this world in this session; they were faster than any other drivers in the Top 8 by quite a significant margin.

2. Both Mercedes drivers seem to struggle a lot with race trimmed setup, and it seems that their qualifying sacrifice isn’t working as it is supposed to right now.

3. In the closing stages of the race, Yuki Tsunoda was the 4th fastest driver, just sitting behind the Top 3 finishers of the sprint race.

4. From Lap 16 to the end, Lewis Hamilton is the slowest driver out of all the sprint race points scorers, this further proves that Mercedes might have wrongfully set up the car.

1. Max Verstappen reigns supreme once again, winning his 17th race of the season, 52nd win of his career. He has now broken the record for the highest percentage win in a season.

2. Lando Norris pitted later than Max Verstappen, which gave him a pace advantage in the closing stages of the race.

3. Lewis Hamilton’s pace on his second stint was the worst out of all point scorers. He has been struggling this whole weekend as his team pulled a blunder in setting up the car.

4. Cars with Ferrari engines seem to face issues due to the nature of Sao Paulo being high altitude.

5. Fernando Alonso did an amazing job keeping his podium spot; he defended against a faster Sergio Perez for many laps.

6. Lando Norris’ median pace was only 0.2s slower than Max Verstappen; it shows how much Mclaren has evolved since the start of the season.
