Key Takeaways from the Qualifying session:

1. Into turn 1, the top three drivers (CL16, CS55, and MV1) have similar speeds, barely reaching over 350 km/h.

2. Charles Leclerc is later on throttle compared to Carlos Sainz and Max Verstappen throughout the lap, which makes his pole position a bit confusing but interesting.

3. Throughout Sector 2, Carlos Sainz was seen to be the earliest to step on the brakes. It was assumed he might want to take care of his tyres for the last sector.

4. In the last sector, Max Verstappen was seen to be braking early compared to the other drivers from the top 3.

5. As quoted by Max Verstappen, the track is considered to be difficult as the surface is slippery. The ability to push the car to the limit might affect the tyre temperatures.

Key Takeaways from the Main Race:

1. Max Verstappen won the Mexico City GP with a comfortable lead of nearly a quarter of a second; his median lap was an astonishing 1:22:4.

2. Lewis Hamilton was the fastest driver throughout the closing stages.

3. Lando Norris became the third fastest driver post-lap 54, nearly matching Lewis Hamilton. He was inevitable in the race as he went from the back of the grid to finishing in double digit points.

4. George Russell has been struggling with the Mercedes W14, as he wasn't able to be near Lewis Hamilton's pace throughout the race.

5. Sergio Perez is the biggest loser of this race; he was on track to be quick but made a mistake during lap 1, which caused his retirement from the race.

6. Esteban Ocon went for a single stop, changing his old hards to a fresh medium on a red flag stop. His tyre-saving technique rewards him with a point finish.
