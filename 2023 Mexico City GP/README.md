Key Takeaways from the Qualifying session:

1. Into turn 1, the top three drivers (CL16, CS55, and MV1) have similar speeds, barely reaching over 350 km/h.

2. Charles Leclerc is later on throttle compared to Carlos Sainz and Max Verstappen throughout the lap, which makes his pole position a bit confusing but interesting.

3. Throughout Sector 2, Carlos Sainz was seen to be the earliest to step on the brakes. It was assumed he might want to take care of his tyres for the last sector.

4. In the last sector, Max Verstappen was seen to be braking early compared to the other drivers from the top 3.

5. As quoted by Max Verstappen, the track is considered to be difficult as the surface is slippery. The ability to push the car to the limit might affect the tyre temperatures.
