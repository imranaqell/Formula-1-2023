Key Points from the Qualifying session:

1. Max Verstappen once again reigns supreme by qualifying in pole position.

2. Lando Norris was up on Max Verstappen's time before his car's rear end decided to step out.

3. Max Verstappen's rapid qualifying is mainly due to the second sector, in which no drivers could come close.

4. Oscar Piastri outqualifies George Russell and Lando Norris. He was quick on the throttle in the first sector, and he matches his teammate's throttle pattern in the remaining sectors.

1. Max Verstappen was the fastest driver in every stint, and Sergio Perez comes close when he is in clean air.

2. Yuki Tsunoda seems to have had some issues with his car during the last stint; his pace wasn't improving even to the end of the race.

3. In Mclaren, Lando Norris was quicker in the first and second stints; in the third stint, they were equal to each other.

4. Carlos Sainz is the victim of a team decision blunder; he finished in the bottom 5 due to his team waiting for a safety car, which didn't come.

5. Logan Sargeant did an amazing job by defending Daniel Ricciardo, who was significantly faster, which will cause Williams to lose P7 in the constructors championship.
