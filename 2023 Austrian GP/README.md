Key Takeaways from the Qualifying session:

1. Charles Leclerc was pushing like crazy in the last run of Q3.

2. Charles Leclerc was more confident on the throttle compared to Max Verstappen, who is cautious due to violating the track limits multiple times before.

3. George Russell and Sergio Perez are the biggest losers from the qualifying session.

4. The track limits out of the final two corners are unnecessary.

5. Both Aston Martin drivers seem to struggle with qualifying pace.

6. Lando Norris' effort, which consistently qualifies him in the top 5 throughout the whole session, should not be overlooked.

7. Ferrari seems to have its upgrades working.
