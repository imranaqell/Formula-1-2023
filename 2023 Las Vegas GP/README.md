1. Both of the Ferrari drivers were fastest on single-lap pace, as they were able to secure a 1-2 with only 0.044s separating them.

2. The minor margin between Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz was due to Charles stomping on the throttle marginally earlier compared to Carlos Sainz.

3. Max Verstappen sacrificed his qualifying for the race; he qualified more than 0.3s away from the time Charles Leclerc set.

4. George Russell's time was marginally slower than Max Verstappenâ€™s; their telemetry showed quite a similar speed throughout the laps.
