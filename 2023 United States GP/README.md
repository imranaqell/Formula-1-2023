2. Charles Leclerc shines in every straight line compared to Lewis Hamilton and Lando Norris.

3. Charles Leclerc was able to maximise his car's brake by braking later in nearly every corner.

4. Lando Norris is the earliest braker out of the top 3, but he was able to make up time out of corner exits. This is the perfect example of slow in, fast out.
